Hi there,

I'm a designer in Charlotte, N.C.

My motivation to learn, my unquenchable thirst for self-development, the pursuit of professional growth, and the thrill of exceeding expectations drive my work ethic. Listening is my strength. Earning trust is my goal. And my mission is that, through my work, I can better the world and how people experience it.

The end.
